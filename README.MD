# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! This project is aimed at providing an interactive and visually appealing tool to understand various sorting algorithms.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are crucial for optimizing data processing. However, grasping their functionality and efficiency can be challenging. Sorting Visualizer bridges this gap by offering a hands-on experience.

## Features

1. **Interactive Interface**: Easily visualize sorting algorithms in action through a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
   Colored representation of step being executed:-
   i) Grey: default ii) DarkGreen: Being compared 1.3) Magenta: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 1.4) Green: In correct position
2. **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
3. **Customization**: Adjust array size, sorting speed, and colors to tailor the visualization to your preferences.
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Observe algorithm performance metrics such as comparisons and swaps in real-time.
5. **Educational Resource**: Ideal for students, developers, and enthusiasts alike to learn, experiment, and understand sorting algorithms better.
